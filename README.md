*Disclaimer*

> With B.tech Mech. background and spending my initial 3.5 years of career in various Non-tech fields as a Mech R&D Design engg. and as a SaaS Sales Person, it's safe to say I am having an immense challenge in learning DSA at 27 years of age from scratch. 

>So I'm creating this repo in order for my future reference as well as for anyone who wants to take this journey for themselves as well. I know how challenging it is to figure out what is what for a newbie to this.

>Total transparency, I enrolled myself in the 1st Master's cohort of Scaler Neovarsity to learn Software engg., but I am also studying the topics from the internet as well.

>So I'll be including all my learnings to give a very solid foundation which is easy to understand and retain.
