# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java

This repo contains everything needed to learn and master DSA(Both theory and questions) from scratch in a beginner-friendly structure.

*Disclaimer*

> I'm a B.tech Mech. graduate with an initial 3.5 years professional career in various Non-tech fields as a Mech R&D Design engg. followed by a SaaS Sales Person.

> I truly understand the challenges faced by a non-CS background person to learn and understand the concepts of DSA and Software engg. in general.

>Total transparency, I enrolled myself in the 1st Master's cohort of Scaler Neovarsity to learn Software engg., but I am also studying the topics from the internet as well.

>So I'll be including all my learnings to give a very solid foundation which is easy to understand and retain.
